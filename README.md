## RT-DETR Models for Real-Time Tree Crown Detection

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of RT-DETR models for detecting tree crowns in high-resolution aerial images. The study explores metrics such as AP50, AP75, and Average Recall, comparing RT-DETR with traditional frameworks like YOLO and Faster R-CNN. Special attention is given to the efficiency of Dynamic Sparse Patterns (DSP) configurations, which balance precision and computational cost.

## Overview

The project is based on the dataset and methodologies introduced by Fran√ßa et al. in their study on tree crown detection using deep learning:
Tree Crown Detection Using Advanced Object Detection Techniques.

We also leverage the RT-DETR repositories and techniques shared by Zhao et al., as introduced in their work on real-time object detection:
DETRs Beat YOLOs on Real-time Object Detection.

## The provided code includes:

Training and evaluation scripts for RT-DETR models.
Dataset preparation following the structure proposed by Fran√ßa et al..
Comparative analysis of model performance, including DSP configurations.
Metrics computation for AP50, AP75, AP50:95, Average Recall, and computational costs.
Key Features
Dataset: The dataset comprises 220 non-overlapping $512 \times 512$ pixel aerial images annotated with 3,382 tree crowns, as described by Fran√ßa et al..
Models Evaluated: Fourteen RT-DETR models with varying backbones, including HGNetV2 and ResNet (18, 34, 50, 101).
Metrics: AP50, AP75, AP50:95, and Average Recall, along with computational efficiency (parameters and training time).
DSP Configurations: Analysis of DSP strategies that optimize precision and computational cost.
